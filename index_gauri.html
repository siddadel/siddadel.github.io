            It took 4 cowards and 7 bullets to murder this fearless woman journalist. She was also a rationalist who wrote in Kannada. She published the popular magazine "Lankesh" for which had received repeated death and rape threats over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
There is a gathering in her memory and condemning her killing. Please do go if you are alarmed at the murder of rationalists.
